The following is a project completed through the Google Cybersecurity
Professional Program. The repository includes a PDF documentation of my work. 
The document shows the steps I took to modify the priviledges 
of several different files for the user, group, and other. The goal of this 
project is to show my ability to manage file permissions in a Linux environment.
